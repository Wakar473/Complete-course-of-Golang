Q.1-What is heterogeneous and homogeneous?

A truly heterogeneous collection is a data structure or collection 
that can store and manage elements of different types simultaneously. 
Unlike homogeneous collections (e.g., an array of integers or a slice of strings, 
where all elements must be of the same type), heterogeneous collections can hold mixed types 
such as integers, strings, booleans, custom structs, etc.
